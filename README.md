# CIS-3750-Wireframe
A simple wireframe of a website designed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Bootstrap.
This is a wireframe, meaning it is only used for demo purposes. It was used to showcase to clients what the potential website would look and feel like - Database functionality and error-checking is not accounted for in this type of prototype.
